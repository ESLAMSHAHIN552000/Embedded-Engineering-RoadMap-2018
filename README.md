# Embedded-Engineering-RoadMap-2018


> This is a work in progress... permanently

Below you find a set of charts demonstrating the paths that you can take and the technologies that you would want to adopt in order to become an embedded systems engineer. I made these charts to simplify the perspective of learning several technologies.

If you think that these can be improved in anyway, please start an issue or pull request, Iâ€™ll be maintaining this repository yearly, the source files can be edited using [Balsamiq Mockups](https://balsamiq.com/download/)
