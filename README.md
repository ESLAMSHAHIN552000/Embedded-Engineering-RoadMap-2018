# Embedded-Engineering-RoadMap-2018


> This is a work in progress... permanently

Below you find a set of charts demonstrating the paths that you can take and the technologies that you would want to adopt in order to become an embedded systems engineer. I made these charts in order to simplify the perspective of learning several technologies, and help out, with recruting, and people who want to get into the industry.

If you think that these can be improved in anyway, please start an issue or pull request, ill be maiteining this roadmap yearly.
